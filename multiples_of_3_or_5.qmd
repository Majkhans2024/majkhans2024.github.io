title: "Multiples of 3 or 5"

### If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23. Find the sum of all multiples of 3 or 5 belowe 1000.

From: <https://projecteuler.net/problem=1>

My solution:

```{python}
sum_ = 0
for n in range(1,1000):
    multiple_three = n%3
    multiple_five = n%5
    if multiple_three == 0 or multiple_five == 0:
        sum_ = sum_ + n
print("Answer: ", sum_)
```
In this project, I created a simple algorithm to sort numbers into 3 categories: a multiple of 3, a multiple of 5 and neither. These numbers are added together with each iteration to form the final answer.
